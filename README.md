# Copula Ordinal Regression
Copula Ordinal Regression is a statistical lerning method in which the goal is to predict a set of discrete ordinal variables. For example, predicting the intensity of different facial action units on a scale from 0 to 5 can be considered an mutli-output ordinal regression task.
This is a generalization of the multi-label classification task, where the set of classification problem is restricted to binary classification, and of the multi-class classification task.

##### Install instructions:
requires:
* Python (>= 2.6 or >= 3.3),
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Theano (>= 0.7)
* PyStruct (>= 0.2.4)
* scikit-learn (>= 0.18)

First, get the code from Github:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RWalecki/copula_ordinal_regression.git
```

Next, go into the directory where the clone was placed and run the installation script:
```
cd copula_ordinal_regression
python setup.py install
```

##### Test the installation:
Once you have installed copula_ordinal_regression, you should run the nosetests before using it.
Therefore, run:
```
nosetests .
```
The tests should not take longer than a few seconds. You are ready to use copula_ordinal_regression. Enjoy!

##### Quick-Start:
You should read through the scripts that are located in the __demo__ folder to understand how the models are applied. The files are heavily commented and are basically a small tutorial.
'__copula_classification.py__' contains an example of how to train the model and use it to predict structured outputs (multiple Facial Action Units in that case).
